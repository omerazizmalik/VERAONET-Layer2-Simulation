📖 Overview

This repository provides the experimental implementation and simulation scripts used in the paper
“VERAONET: A Virtual Ecosystem for Rewards and Archaeological Operations Network” —
a Layer-2 blockchain framework designed for archaeological data management and digital heritage preservation.

VERAONET introduces a pluggable consensus mechanism that dynamically switches between:

Proof of Work (PoW)

Adjustable Proof of Work (APoW)

Proof of Stake (PoS)

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

based on real-time network load, system resources, and operational context.
The goal is to achieve scalability, sustainability, and cost efficiency for cultural heritage applications such as artifact provenance, milestone-based rewards, and museum record verification.

⚙️ Experimental Setup
1. Dependencies

Go Ethereum (Geth): v1.14.2 (base fork)

Ganache CLI: v7.9+

Python 3.11 / Jupyter Notebook

Node.js: v20+ (for local simulation scripts)

GoLang: v1.21+

2. Configuration

Edit config_thresholds.json to define switching triggers:

{
  "low_load": 250,
  "medium_load": 2500,
  "high_load": 7000,
  "latency_threshold": 500,
  "energy_threshold": 0.7
}

3. Running Simulations

Local Simulation (Ganache):

cd experiments/ganache_tests
python3 run_simulation.py --users 500 --consensus adaptive


Public Geth Testbed:

cd experiments/geth_tests
go run adaptive_switch.go --config config_thresholds.json


Results are stored automatically in /results as CSVs.

📊 Results Summary

Gas Consumption: ↓ 82% compared to Ethereum PoW baseline

Latency: ↓ 67% under high-load DPoS scenarios

Energy Consumption: ↓ 58% overall

Transaction Throughput: ↑ 2.5× improvement on simulated 10k-node network

🧠 Integration with Virtual Museum Platform

This implementation links directly with the companion repository:
🔗 Virtual-Reality-Museum

That repository demonstrates how VERAONET integrates with ArchaeoMeta and Archaeological Workflows, including:

Artifact upload and provenance verification

Smart-contract reward distribution

Decentralized governance and reputation tracking
